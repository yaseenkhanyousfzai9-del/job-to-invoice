OBJECTIVE
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
SOP
 
is
 
to
 
convert
 
an
 
approved
 
Product
 
Requirements
 
Document
 
into
 
a
 
high-quality,
 
fully
 
functioning
 
iOS
 
and
 
Android
 
application
 
as
 
quickly
 
and
 
reliably
 
as
 
possible.
 
For
 
suitable
 
applications,
 
the
 
target
 
is:
 
Day
 
1:
 
Architecture
 
+
 
foundation
 
+
 
primary

2:
 
Feature

+

+

Day
 
3:
 
QA
 
+
 
security
 
+
 
PRD
 
audit
 
+
 
production
 
builds
 
+
 
distribution
 
The
 
target
 
outcome
 
is
 
not
 
merely:
 
“The
 
app
 
runs.”
 
The
 
target
 
outcome
 
is:
 
A
 
production-quality
 
release
 
candidate
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
audited
 
against
 
the
 
original
 
PRD,
 
tested
 
on
 
physical
 
devices,
 
instrumented,
 
secured,
 
built
 
for
 
iOS/Android
 
and
 
made
 
available
 
for
 
founder
 
testing
 
or
 
store
 
submission.

NON-NEGOTIABLE
 
PRINCIPLE
 
AI

do
 
not
 
make

on

The

AI
 
recommendation
 
If
 
Cursor
 
or
 
Claude
 
suggests
 
something
 
conflicting
 
with
 
the
 
PRD,
 
the
 
PRD
 
wins
 
unless
 
the
 
developer
 
formally
 
records
 
why
 
the
 
requirement
 
is
 
technically
 
impossible,
 
unsafe
 
or
 
contradictory.
 
Never
 
silently
 
modify
 
requirements
 
because
 
implementation
 
would
 
be
 
easier.

RESPONSIBILITY
 
SPLIT
 
Cursor

Primary
 
Builder
 
Cursor
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
approximately
 
80–90%
 
of

.
 
Use
 
Cursor
 
for:
 
●

Claude
 
Code

Senior
 
Engineer
 
/
 
Red

Claude

should
 
not
 
duplicate
 
everything
 
Cursor
 
is
 
doing.
 
Use
 
Claude
 
primarily
 
for:
 
●

Claude
 
should
 
normally
 
review
 
or
 
solve
 
difficult
 
problems
,
 
rather
 
than
 
continuously
 
rewriting
 
Cursor's
 
work.
 
This
 
reduces:
 
●
 
Token
 
usage
 
●
 
Conflicting
 
changes
 
●
 
Duplicate
 
work
 
●
 
Architectural
 
drift

STANDARD
 
The

for:
 
●

24.
 
DATABASE
 
STANDARD
 
All
 
database
 
changes
 
should
 
be
 
reproducible.
 
Use
 
migrations.
 
Do
 
not
 
rely
 
upon:
 
“I
 
manually
 
created
 
the
 
table
 
in
 
the

Production
 
tables
 
should
 
include

foreign
 
keys
 
●

●

26.
 
SUBSCRIPTION
 
STANDARD
 
RevenueCat
 
should
 
ordinarily
 
control
 
mobile
 
subscription
 
entitlement.
 
The
 
application
 
should
 
reason
 
in
 
terms
 
of:

27.

STANDARD
 
Define

before

At
 
minimum:

onboarding_started
 
onboarding_completed

Product-specific

should
 
be

to
 
the
 
PRD.
 
Include
 
useful
 
properties
 
such
 
as:

Do
 
not

must
 
be

before

BUG
 
ESCALATION
 
PROTOCOL
 
When
 
Cursor
 
fails
 
twice
 
on
 
essentially
 
the
 
same
 
problem:
 
Stop
 
prompting
 
it
 
with
 
variations
 
of
 
“try
 
again.”
 
Do
 
this:
 
Step
 
1
 
Revert
 
unnecessary
 
speculative
 
edits.
 
Step
 
2
 
Document:
 
Expected:
 
Actual:
 
Reproduction:
 
Relevant
 
logs:
 
Attempts:
 
 
Step
 
3
 
Give
 
the
 
problem
 
to
 
Claude
 
Code
 
as
 
a
 
root-cause
 
investigation.
 
Step
 
4
 
Have
 
Claude
 
propose
 
the
 
fix.
 


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 49 -->

Step
 
5
 
Either
 
Claude
 
or
 
Cursor
 
implements
 
exactly
 
one
 
coherent
 
fix.
 
Step
 
6
 
Add
 
regression
 
test.
 
This
 
prevents
 
AI
 
debugging
 
loops
 
that
 
waste
 
hours.

DEFINITION
 
OF
 
APP
 
COMPLETE
 
The
 
app
 
is
 
complete
 
only
 
when:
 
The
 
approved
 
PRD
 
has
 
been
 
implemented
 
and
 
audited
 
requirement-by-requirement;
 
the
 
primary
 
user
 
journeys
 
function

on
 
production-equivalent
 
iOS
 
and
 
Android
 
builds;
 
backend
 
authorization
 
and
 
data
 
access
 
have
 
been
 
reviewed;
 
subscription
 
functionality
 
has
 
been
 
tested
 
where
 
applicable;
 
analytics
 
and
 
crash
 
monitoring
 
have
 
been
 
verified;
 
critical
 
automated
 
tests
 
pass;
 
no
 
BLOCKER
 
or
 
HIGH
 
defects
 
remain;
 
and
 
a
 
release
 
candidate
 
has
 
been
 
distributed
 
to
 
TestFlight/Google
 
Play
 
Internal
 
Testing
 
or
 
submitted
 
for

GOLDEN
 
RULE
 
The
 
company
 
is
 
not
 
trying
 
to
 
produce
 
the
 
largest
 
quantity
 
of
 
code
 
in
 
72
 
hours
.
 
The
 
company
 
is
 
trying
 
to
 
produce:
 
the
 
smallest,
 
cleanest,
 
fully
 
functioning
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
approved
 
PRD
 
that
 
we
 
would
 
be
 
comfortable
 
spending
 
serious
 
acquisition
 
capital
 
to
 
put
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
real
 
users.

Cursor
 
accelerates

Claude

The
