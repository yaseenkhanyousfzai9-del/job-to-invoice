Job to Invoice Product Requirements
Document
Developer handoff and release specification
Version 1.0 | 11 September 2026 | Prepared for Ahmed Waleed Bajwa and the implementation team
Build objective
Create an iPhone app and secure customer approval website for solo service businesses. Keep the original quote,
approved extra work and final invoice consistent, with reliable recovery and complete financial history.
Use this as the shared product, engineering and QA contract. It includes launch decisions, 28 screen specifications,
database and API contracts, 12 financial fixtures, 68 acceptance scenarios, and operational release gates.
Proposed requirements describe the app to be built; they are not claims that implementation or validation is
already complete.
Launch baseline
US market • English • USD • One owner per business • iPhone first • Browser-based customer review • Manual
recording of externally handled payments
Read first
Sections 01 to 06 define scope and invariants. Sections 07 to 18 define product behaviour. Sections 19 to 27
define implementation and safeguards. Sections 28 to 36 define testing, release and handover. Section 34 lists the
owner-supplied production inputs.

01 Purpose and document authority
Build an iPhone application that lets a solo residential service operator create a quote, obtain approval for
additional work, and issue an invoice containing the approved charges. Customers review and approve through a
secure mobile website without installing an app. This document specifies the first production release, including
product behaviour, interface requirements, calculation rules, persistence, APIs, security, operations and
acceptance tests.
The central promise is “Keep every approved extra on the final invoice.” The first audience is US sole proprietors
and small owner-operated handyman businesses. This is the selected launch assumption from the preceding
opportunity analysis, not a validated claim that all handymen need this product. Validate the workflow with real
users while implementing it. The working title Job to Invoice is descriptive, not a cleared brand.
MUST means a release requirement. SHOULD means a post-launch improvement unless explicitly included in the
release matrix. MAY means an implementation option that cannot weaken a MUST. Requirements carry IDs so
designers, engineers and QA can trace delivery. The product rules in this document prevail over illustrative copy
and examples; financial invariants and authorization rules prevail over screen shortcuts. Resolve a true conflict by
recording a numbered decision and updating this document, rather than silently picking a behaviour.
This is a build specification, not existing software or a representation that production credentials, legal terms, user
validation or store approval already exist. The engineering team must supply source code, executable API schemas,
migrations, automated tests and operational configuration as implementation deliverables. External account
credentials and final business identity cannot be invented; section 34 assigns those launch inputs with safe
development defaults. No ordinary workflow decision is intentionally left to the developer to guess.
02 Release decisions and boundaries
ID Decision Release baseline
DEC01 Platform
iPhone first; iOS 17 or later as the product minimum, raised only if
selected supported dependencies require it and documented
before sprint one. Current Apple submission SDK requirements
override this minimum.
DEC02 Customer interface Responsive browser portal, Safari and Chrome, no customer app or
persistent customer account.
DEC03 Geography and language US storefront, English US, USD only; US business address. Customer
browsers may access from other locations.
DEC04 Tenant model
One verified owner and one business workspace per account. Same
owner can use two signed-in iPhones; no staff invitations or
ownership transfer in v1.
DEC05 Payments Record payments and refunds received outside the app. No card
entry, payment collection, escrow, financing or payout promises.
DEC06 App monetization Three lifetime free published jobs, optional 14-day app-managed
trial, monthly and annual Apple subscriptions.
DEC07 Approval
Email code verification followed by explicit approval of an
immutable document revision. No claim of notarization, identity
certification or universal legal enforceability.

ID Decision Release baseline
DEC08 Documents
One approved base quote, sequential approved extra-work orders,
one active final invoice per job; revisions, voiding, limited invoice
credits and manual payment corrections are defined below.
DEC09 Tax
Operator-selected tax-exclusive rate per line. No jurisdiction
inference, automated tax advice, filings or claim of nationwide tax
compliance.
DEC10 Connectivity
Offline draft editing and cached reading. Sending, approval,
financial ledger changes, invoice issue and purchase verification
require connectivity.
DEC11 AI
No custom AI model, autonomous pricing, image interpretation or
generative contract terms. Ordinary keyboard dictation may be
used.
DEC12 Distribution No tracking SDK or advertising identifier in v1. First-party aggregate
funnel measurement; no fingerprinting or cross-app tracking.
DEC13 Support In-app support and a monitored public support address. No 24-hour
support claim unless staffed.
DEC14 Scope reductions
Before invoicing, use a customer-approved reduction order. After
invoicing, use an owner-issued credit note with reason. Neither
edits prior approvals.
Included in v1: authentication, business setup, customer records, service-item catalogue, draft recovery, quotes,
additions and reductions, secure approvals, invoice creation, PDF output, manual payments/refunds, credit notes,
subscription management, exports, account deletion, notifications, limited support console, first-party analytics
and operational monitoring.
Deferred: Android operator app, full operator web app, staff seats, customer accounts, automated payment
reminders, payment-provider links, recurring invoices, deposits invoiced separately, progress billing, multiple
invoices per job, card processing, accounting integrations, inventory, scheduling, dispatch, GPS, mileage, payroll,
expense OCR, pricing AI, voice-agent interaction, multi-currency, inclusive VAT and tax filing. Android is a separate
release with its own billing and policy acceptance gate; shared TypeScript does not make it automatically
complete.
Manual payment entries may be recorded only after an invoice exists. A pre-invoice deposit can be represented as
an informational note and recorded with its actual received date when the final invoice is issued. The app must
make clear that a note does not reduce the balance. Users requiring deposit invoices or progress claims are
outside the first release audience.
03 Product outcomes and validation
ID Metric Exact definition and initial target
MET01 Activation
Verified owner publishes a real non-demo quote or direct invoice
within seven days of signup. Target at least 35 percent of qualified
signups; hypothesis.
MET02 Core workflow adoption
Among owners with at least one approved quote, percentage with
a customer-approved change in 30 days. Segment by owners
reporting extra work; do not force changes to inflate it.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 5 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 5 of 42
ID Metric Exact definition and initial target
MET03 Repeat job use
Activated owner publishes another distinct real job within 30 days.
Initial pilot gate at least 50 percent of operators who had another
eligible job.
MET04 First invoice speed
Median active editing time from invoice preview open to issued
invoice for an approved job under two minutes; exclude idle
intervals above 30 seconds.
MET05 Reliability
Zero known lost committed documents, duplicate financial events
or cross-tenant disclosures at release. Monthly crash-free sessions
target at least 99.5 percent.
MET06 Monetization
Paying owner is server-verified active subscription with first
transaction not refunded; measure conversion after full trial
observation, not at trial start.
MET07 Acquisition
CAC equals attributable media cost divided by non-refunded new
paying owners; report unknown attribution separately. Initial target
USD 40 to 50 is a business hypothesis.
MET08 Retention
Monthly subscription renewal by acquisition cohort and weekly
business activity. Annual subscription purchase is not evidence of
annual retention.
Interview at least 20 eligible operators before public launch. Ask for actual recent examples rather than
hypothetical preference. Five paid pilot commitments and repeated usage are the initial business gates. These are
capital-allocation criteria; they must never alter accounting calculations or app authorization.

Infrastructure
operator
Maintain deployment, recover

procedure
Routine browsing of customer content or bypassing application
audit for convenience
AUTHZ01: Every resource read and mutation derives workspace membership from verified server identity. A
workspace ID in a route or body is never evidence of authorization. Cross-tenant object references return generic
404. Public approval sessions are scoped to one request and cannot exchange into owner sessions. Support
permissions use separate staff identities with mandatory MFA and no shared accounts.
05 Domain vocabulary and invariants
A job groups one customer and one site. A quote is the proposed initial scope. A document revision is the
immutable rendered-and-hashed snapshot published to a customer. A change order modifies the accepted scope
before invoicing. A source line is an approved line from the base quote or an addition. A reduction consumes part
of the remaining net/tax value of a source line. An invoice is a fixed billing snapshot. A credit note reduces an
issued invoice without overwriting it. A payment/refund entry records money handled elsewhere. An approval
request controls verified customer access and the decision window.
INV01: Monetary amounts use integer USD cents; quantity uses a decimal string with at most three decimal
places. Never calculate money with binary floating point. Server results are authoritative; mobile uses the same
shared calculation package for previews.
INV02: Accepted quotes, accepted changes, issued invoices, issued credits, decisions and ledger entries are
immutable. Corrections create a new version, reversal or credit; no UPDATE may rewrite an accepted commercial
fact.
INV03: A document revision includes a canonical snapshot and SHA-256 digest of those canonical bytes. PDF bytes
have a separate digest. A digest is an integrity control, not evidence that a person was legally identified. JSON key
ordering, number/string representation and array order are fixed by schema version.
INV04: At most one pending approval request exists for a job. Each request binds document revision, recipient
email, scope version, expiry and consent-text version. Approval and cancellation race on one database lock;
exactly one terminal result wins.
INV05: Approved additions/reductions update the job scope version atomically. Final invoice issue locks that
scope version and rejects pending requests or unpublished change drafts until explicitly resolved. No approved
charge disappears because the user edited a catalogue item or business profile.
INV06: Financial numbering is unique and monotonic within workspace and document type. Numbers are never
reused after voiding. An allocated number lost to a failed issue is retained as a void/reserved audit record rather
than silently recycled.
INV07: Payment status is derived from invoice, credits, posted payments and refunds. “Mark paid” is an entry
flow, not a writable status flag. Owner-reported payment does not mean independently verified bank settlement.
INV08: Archived data is hidden from default lists, not deleted. Subscription expiry never removes record access or
completion rights on jobs already published. Account deletion is a distinct intentional workflow.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 7 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 7 of 42
INV09: A published job counts once against the lifetime free limit or trial publication cap. Revisions, changes,
invoices, credits and retries do not consume additional jobs. Deletion, archiving, cancellations and reinstalls do
not replenish used slots.
INV10: Server UTC is authoritative for acceptance and expiry. Local dates and times are displayed using the
workspace IANA timezone; date-only fields never round-trip through midnight UTC conversion.
06 End to end journeys
First useful job
JRN01: New operator sees the product promise and a sample document, then selects Create my first quote. The
operator enters email and a code, completes three short setup steps, adds customer and site, adds line items, and
previews totals. Publishing shows a review sheet with recipient and expiry. Confirming publishes a frozen revision,
consumes one job slot if necessary, and queues delivery. The operator sees Published and a separate delivery
indicator. A queued email is not labelled Delivered.
Customer approval
JRN02: Recipient opens the secure link. The landing page reveals only business display name and document type.
The recipient requests a code sent to the bound email, enters it, and reviews scope, prices, tax, total, expiry,
terms and attachments. The recipient enters their name, checks an unticked acknowledgement and selects
Approve quote or Approve extra work. The server records the exact revision and returns a durable receipt. A
refresh shows the same decision and cannot create another approval.
Additional work
JRN03: For an accepted quote, the owner chooses Add extra work, optionally takes a photo, enters description
and price, and sees the change total and new job total separately. The recipient approves the current change. It
joins the accepted scope. A later change starts from the new scope version. The original approved quote remains
unchanged.
Reduced scope
JRN04: Owner selects Reduce agreed work and chooses an approved source line with remaining value. Owner
specifies a net reduction in dollars and a reason. Tax reduction is calculated automatically from the original tax
amount. Recipient approves the reduction and sees old job total, reduction including tax, and new job total. The
system cannot reduce a source line below zero or the job total below zero.
Invoice and money tracking
JRN05: Owner chooses Create final invoice. The app resolves every change draft or pending request first, then
previews accepted scope, additions, reductions, invoice due date and payment instructions. Confirm issues the
invoice. Owner may share it, record money received, issue a correcting credit, or record a refund. The customer
sees outstanding balance labelled as reported by the business.
Direct invoice without quote
JRN06: An operator billing completed work may choose New job then Invoice without quote. The owner enters
line items and issues an invoice without a customer approval flow. The document explicitly states that it was not
preceded by in-app scope approval. This job cannot later add pre-invoice changes. This exception delivers
ordinary invoicing without implying customer consent.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 8 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 8 of 42
Interrupted work
JRN07: Owner loses connectivity during draft editing. Saved on this device is shown after local persistence, not
before. Publish is disabled with a reconnect explanation. On recovery the draft synchronizes using version
checking. A conflicting remote edit prompts a comparison and deliberate choice; the app never silently overwrites
either version.
07 Navigation and visual specification
The owner app has four bottom tabs: Jobs, Customers, Items and Settings. Jobs is the default. A prominent New
job action remains accessible on the Jobs screen; avoid a floating control that obscures list content. Job detail is
the central workspace with Overview, Documents and Activity sections in one scrollable page. No dashboard of
speculative revenue or “money recovered” claims.
UI01: Use system San Francisco typography; body 17 pt, secondary 15 pt, section title 22 pt semibold, screen title
28 pt bold. Support Dynamic Type through accessibility sizes. Use an 8 pt spacing scale, 16 pt screen gutters and
12 pt corner radius. Primary navy #17324D, background #F7F8FA, text #17212B, secondary #52606D, border
#D5DCE3. Status colours require text and icons, never colour alone. Test every actual text/background pair for
accessibility.
UI02: Buttons minimum 48 pt height and 44 by 44 pt tappable region. Primary action is full-width at the end of
forms; long forms may use a safe-area sticky action bar. Keep destructive actions separated and labelled with
consequence. Numeric inputs use decimal keyboards; prices display USD prefix; quantity has a unit label. Respect
device safe areas, keyboard avoidance and screen-reader focus.
UI03: V1 light appearance is the designed baseline; explicitly opt out of unsupported automatic dark inversion.
Web portal uses a single column up to 720 CSS px, 16 px mobile gutter, 18 px body text, 48 px buttons. Customer
line items stack label and quantity/price/tax on narrow screens. All customer actions remain reachable at 320 CSS
px width and 200 percent zoom.
UI04: Every data screen has loading, empty, loaded, refresh failure, offline and access-expired behaviours. Cached
content stays visible during refresh with a timestamp. Skeleton loading must not shift controls dangerously. Inline
validation preserves all entered values and focuses the first invalid field. Error banners have Retry only when retry
is safe.
08 Screen inventory and field contracts
Each screen ID is a required design frame and QA coverage unit. Screen layouts are specified here; the
implementation designer must deliver matching Figma or equivalent editable layouts, interactive core-flow
prototype, and all state variants before UI signoff. These design deliverables are part of the development contract,
not claimed attachments to this PRD.

Field validation
VAL01: Business display name 2 to 100 characters; legal name 2 to 150; operator name 2 to 100; job title 1 to 120;
customer display name 1 to 120. Trim outer whitespace, reject control characters except newlines in multiline
fields, preserve Unicode names. Email up to 254 characters, normalized for lookup without provider-specific
dot/plus rewriting; preserve original presentation. Customer email is mandatory for approval requests, optional
for manually shared direct invoices. Phone optional, E.164 where parsable, otherwise show validation rather than
guessing country.
VAL02: US address: line 1 max 150, line 2 optional max 150, city max 80, state two-letter selection, ZIP five digits
or ZIP plus four. Site address is optional for remote/service invoices, but ask the user to explicitly choose No site
address. Billing and site addresses are distinct. Business timezone defaults to the device IANA zone and requires
confirmation; dates use MM/DD/YYYY presentation.
VAL03: Line description 1 to 500 characters; unit enum item, hour, day, square_foot, linear_foot or custom label
up to 20; quantity greater than 0 and at most 999999.999; unit price 0 to 99999999 cents. Fixed line discount at
most the rounded gross line value. At most 100 lines per document, total absolute amount at most 999999999
cents. Currency is USD and cannot be edited. Free lines are permitted but a quote must have at least one positive
net line; invoices with zero balance after approved reductions remain valid.
VAL04: Public scope notes 0 to 2000 characters; commercial terms 0 to 4000; internal notes 0 to 4000 and never
exported in customer PDFs. A reason for reduction, credit or void is required, 5 to 500 characters. Approval typed
name 2 to 100 characters. Terms and notes are plain text with escaped display; no user HTML. All constraints run
client-side for convenience and server-side for enforcement.
09 Accounts customers and catalogue
ACC01: Use email one-time codes for owner authentication through Supabase Auth. Configure six-digit codes,
ten-minute expiry, 60-second resend cooldown and at most five verification failures per challenge. Account
creation and sign-in share one flow; responses do not reveal existing accounts. Configure equivalent or stricter
provider limits and verify the actual SDK behaviour in staging. Never build a second plaintext code store for owner
authentication. Tokens use the supported secure-session mechanism; refresh tokens belong in OS secure storage,
not application logs or analytics.
ACC02: Access tokens are verified server-side for signature, configured issuer/audience, expiry and account status
using supported JWT verification. Expired access attempts trigger one refresh, then sign-in if unsuccessful. An
offline owner may read cached records and edit drafts for up to seven days since last successful authentication;
publishing still requires server authorization. Sign-out warns about unsynced drafts and offers synchronize or


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 11 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 11 of 42
discard local data. Device session revocation clears access at next request; backend account suspension is checked
on every mutation.
ACC02A: For recent-auth operations, request a fresh owner OTP through the same provider, then obtain a
backend single-purpose action grant with a five-minute expiry after verifying the provider authentication time.
Store and consume its hash server-side, bind it to user/action, and send it in X-Action-Grant. The API inventory
includes POST /account/action-grants {action} for export, deletion, email_change and replace_link; it requires a
freshly authenticated session. Ordinary token refresh alone is not fresh authentication. Add
action_grants(id,user_id,action,token_hash,expires_at,used_at) to the restricted identity schema.
ACC03: Email change requires recent reauthentication, verification of the new email, and notification to the old
email. Changing owner email does not change the stable user UUID, workspace, customer recipients or billing
association. A lost owner email requires a documented identity-recovery support process; staff cannot bypass it
by matching an invoice number. Account ownership transfer is unavailable in v1.
CUS01: Customer records can have identical names. Warn on duplicate normalized email within a workspace but
permit separate named contacts after confirmation. A job chooses one approval contact. Editing customer details
affects future drafts only; published snapshots retain original details. Before publication explicitly select Apply
current contact details to draft if the draft contains an older snapshot.
CUS02: Archive a customer to remove it from new-job pickers. Existing jobs and documents remain accessible.
Deleting an unreferenced customer is allowed; if referenced, offer archive and export instead. A privacy request
concerning a customer is handled through the privacy process because approved commercial records may contain
historical references. Do not automatically rewrite historical records on a contact deletion request.
CAT01: Saved items hold description, unit, suggested quantity, unit price cents, fixed discount default zero and tax
rate default zero. Defaults are copied into a new line, never linked live. Seed five editable zero-price examples
such as Labour hour, Materials, Small repair, Installation and Disposal; explain that users set their own prices. No
invented industry rates. Archive retains historical uses. Catalogue search matches description case-insensitively; a
blank query lists most recently used items.
10 Quote and job lifecycle
Job state rules
JOB01: Persist lifecycle as draft, active, invoiced, finished, canceled or archived, plus archived_from_state. Draft
becomes active on first publication. Accepted quote does not mean work completed. Invoiced means a final
invoice has been issued. Finished is an owner action allowed after an invoice is settled or explicitly waived by
credits; finishing never deletes records. A canceled job can retain a receivable and must visibly show it. Archive is
a visibility action allowed from any non-draft state only when no approval is pending; it does not alter financial
status.
JOB02: A draft job can be deleted when it contains no published document. Published jobs cannot be deleted
individually in v1. Cancel requires a reason, withdraws pending approvals and blocks new work; an existing invoice
remains collectible until credited or voided. An active accepted job with no invoice can be canceled; notify the
customer and preserve the prior acceptance. This is an operational cancellation notice, not a legal determination
that all contractual obligations ended. Reopening a canceled job is unavailable; create a linked new job.

accepted Edit request Rejected; use a change order or cancel job
QUO01: Quote expiry defaults to 14 calendar days from publication, interpreted as 23:59:59 in workspace
timezone on the selected date. Owner may choose 1 to 90 days. The server stores resolved expires_at UTC and
the original local date/timezone. Do not adjust expiry after send; extending a quote creates a new request and
frozen revision requiring approval. A request can be resent without extending expiry.
QUO02: Quote labels use Q-000001 per workspace. Drafts display Draft and a local short identifier, not an official
number. Revisions share the original quote number with revision suffix R1, R2 and so on. First publication is R1.
Number allocation, snapshot insert, slot consumption, pending request and outbox event commit in one
transaction. PDF/email generation happens after the commit.
QUO02A: The preview response includes snapshot schema version, frozen business/customer defaults and a ten-
minute preview validity. Publishing after that interval returns PREVIEW_CHANGED and requires regeneration.
Canonical bytes use UTF-8, sorted object keys recursively, explicit nulls for nullable snapshot fields, decimal
quantities as three-place strings, integer cents and stable position/UUID-sorted arrays; exclude request tokens,
live delivery status and generation timestamps. Store the canonical byte representation alongside the parsed
snapshot so later runtime differences do not alter its digest.
QUO03: Changing recipient on a pending request requires withdrawal and a replacement request/revision, even if
pricing is unchanged. The old recipient cannot approve afterward. An accepted quote cannot have its recorded
signer replaced. A new approval contact for future changes requires owner confirmation and is independently
verified for that new request.
11 Change orders and reductions
CHG01: A change order requires an accepted base quote and no issued invoice. Owner can create multiple local
drafts but only one published pending order. Before publishing, rebase its preview onto the latest accepted scope
version and require owner review when that version changed. Invoice issue blocks while any change draft exists
until the owner chooses Publish or Discard; discarded drafts are explicitly confirmed.
CHG02: Addition orders contain one or more normal positive lines. Reduction orders reference one or more
approved source lines and specify positive net-credit amounts in cents; no negative unit prices or quantities. A
single change order may contain additions and reductions when replacing work; customer sees each separately
and the net change. Require a nonzero net or a meaningful scope replacement with a written reason; a zero-value
replacement still requires approval if scope changed.

CHG03: A source line retains original net cents and tax cents, less all previously accepted reductions. A draft
reduction can reference a base-quote or previously approved addition line, not another reduction, an unapproved
line or an unrelated job. Cumulative net reductions cannot exceed the source net. Exactly one pending request
prevents simultaneous competing commitments; approval still rechecks caps in the transaction.
CHG04: Change labels use CO-000001 per workspace, revision suffixes as for quotes. Customer presentation
shows “Previously agreed total”, additions, reductions, “Change including tax” and “New agreed total”. Financial
totals and source references are immutable once sent. Approval increments scope version and marks the included
source values consumed atomically. Declining, expiring or withdrawing never applies the change.
CHG05: Accepted changes cannot be deleted or silently rolled back. To reverse an accepted addition, issue a new
reduction referencing its remaining source value. To restore a reduction, add a new positive line with a reason
and explicit new approval. Never fabricate an approval to repair data. Subscriptions do not block changes on
grandfathered published jobs.
12 Approval security and evidence
APR01: Generate a 256-bit random request token; the request table stores its keyed hash, key version and
request ID. The raw value exists only in process memory and an encrypted, access-restricted delivery payload until
submission completes; purge that payload within 24 hours of terminal delivery status. Never store raw tokens in
ordinary outbox JSON. Use a URL fragment for the raw token, such as /review#token, so it does not enter ordinary
server request logs. The portal exchanges it via POST, clears the fragment with history replacement, and holds a
Secure HttpOnly SameSite cookie. Native browser fallback must not leak the token in a referrer, error report,
email analytics or link preview. All portal responses use no-store and no-referrer controls.
APR01A: Token exchange creates a 20-minute preverified cookie session and returns a random CSRF nonce bound
to that session. Hold the nonce in page memory and return it in X-CSRF-Token for portal mutations; rotate it after
successful code verification. Validate Origin against the portal origin. Owner API uses bearer tokens and does not
accept portal cookies as owner authentication.
APR02: Before verification, reveal only business display name, document type, masked destination email and
access state. Request a six-digit code sent to the bound recipient. Hash public codes with a server-held secret;
expiry ten minutes, one active challenge per request, five failed attempts, resend no faster than 60 seconds,
maximum five sends per hour per request and 20 per IP with an adaptive abuse limit. New code invalidates the
old. Provider delivery failures do not count as verified identity. No code is returned in an API response.
APR03: Successful code verification grants a one-hour scoped customer session. Viewing a decided document is
permitted through a newly verified session while its link remains enabled. Approval request token access lasts 90
days after terminal decision, then requires owner-issued fresh read-only link. If the original PDF is still preparing,
the page shows a retryable preparation state and disables approval until ready. A pending approval expires
according to its commercial expiry even if token access continues. An explicit owner resend or replace-link
command rotates the token and invalidates old sessions while preserving request identity, document version and
commercial expiry. Warn that older links will stop working. A worker retry of the same delivery attempt reuses its
encrypted payload and does not rotate again.
APR04: Approval screen requires the original reviewed PDF artifact in ready state as well as full accessible
snapshot text, typed name and explicit unticked acknowledgement: “I have reviewed this version of the scope and
price and approve it. I understand this records my approval electronically.” Display the commercial terms
separately. Do not require agreement to marketing, app subscription or unrelated privacy processing. No legal-
grade signature certificate claim. If enforceability is required for a specific trade/state, the business owner must
obtain reviewed wording and release approval before making that claim.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 14 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 14 of 42
APR05: Store request ID, document revision ID, snapshot digest, typed name, verified email, decision enum,
server timestamp, consent text version and consent text snapshot. Store a minimized user-agent family and IP
evidence encrypted with restricted access, with retention described in section 25. Do not collect GPS, contact lists
or biometrics. The evidence receipt lists which verification was performed and never asserts government identity
verification.
APR06: Approve requires the request still pending, unexpired, not revoked, exact expected scope version and
exact snapshot hash. Lock request and job, check all predicates, insert one decision, update status/scope and
outbox in the same transaction. Same idempotency key returns same receipt. A different approval after terminal
decision returns existing decision with ALREADY_DECIDED, never another charge. Concurrent decline/approve:
first committed valid command wins, later command receives 409.
APR07: Decline requires an optional comment up to 1000 characters. Store it privately for the owner and in the
decision receipt, escaped. After decline, offer Contact business and Download reviewed document. Editing prices
or renegotiating in the portal is unavailable. No chat feature.
APR08: Owner receives in-app status and transactional email after approval/decline. Customer receives the
reviewed PDF and receipt link. A failed receipt email does not undo the committed approval; it appears as
Delivery failed with retry in owner view. Download remains available to the verified recipient.
13 Monetary calculations and fixtures
FIN01: Quantity q is decimal to three places; price p is integer cents. Round q times p half-up to whole cents to
obtain gross. Subtract fixed per-line discount d to obtain net. Rate r is integer basis points from 0 to 2500,
representing 0 to 25.00 percent. Tax equals half-up of net times r divided by 10000. Sum line net and line tax;
document total equals those two sums. No document-level discount, compounded tax, tax-inclusive prices,
withholding, foreign currency or currency conversion in v1. The 25 percent UI cap is a product constraint, not a
statement of law.
FIN02: Rates and applicability are entered by the operator. Defaults are zero with “Confirm tax treatment for your
business” setup guidance, not an assertion that zero is correct. Public documents show the rate and tax amount
for each taxable line and a summary grouped by rate. Values that cannot be represented by this simple model are
outside v1; the app must not advertise comprehensive US tax compliance.
FIN03: For a source line with original net N and tax T, let prior cumulative accepted net reduction be C and a new
reduction be x. New tax reduction is round_half_up(T times (C+x) divided by N) minus round_half_up(T times C
divided by N). Cap C+x at N. This cumulative method ensures all tax is reversed when the entire source net is
removed and prevents penny drift across partial reductions. N cannot be zero for a reducible line.
FIN04: Invoice lines represent approved additions and base lines with net/tax after accepted reductions, retaining
source IDs and reduction history in the appendix. Snapshot precomputed net and tax; do not recalculate from
current tax defaults. Invoice credits use the same cumulative method against these residual invoice line amounts.
An invoice credit is a billing correction, not an edit to the accepted job scope. Summaries explicitly separate
Agreed job total, Invoice issued total and Credits.
FIN05: Posted payment amounts minus posted refunds produce net money received. Reversals cancel specific
erroneous entries and are not additional cash movements. Balance equals issued invoice total minus issued
credits minus effective payments plus effective refunds. Positive means Amount due; zero means Settled;
negative means Amount to refund or reconcile. Never hide an overpayment with max(balance,0) in the ledger.

The shared money module must ship property tests for nonnegative remaining source amounts, full-credit tax
reversal, associativity of document summation, repeated retry invariance and equality between mobile
preview/server/PDF. No locale-formatted string is accepted as a stored number. API cents fit within the
documented maximum and serialize as integers; larger future totals require a schema revision.
14 Invoices credits payments and corrections
BIL01: Invoice issue requires an accepted base quote or an explicitly direct-invoice job. For quote-based jobs,
every included source is accepted and no unresolved change draft/request remains. Owner reviews due date,
customer billing snapshot and instructions. Default payment term is 14 calendar days, with options Due on receipt,
7, 14, 30 or a chosen date up to 365 days. Due date cannot precede issue date. Issue date is server date in
workspace timezone; payment received dates may be earlier for a deposit recorded after issue.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 16 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 16 of 42
BIL02: Allocate INV-000001 and freeze the invoice in one transaction. Job scope is then closed to change orders. A
worker builds a PDF from the frozen snapshot, uploads it privately and sends when ready. UI distinguishes Issued,
PDF preparing, Ready to share and delivery state. A PDF failure leaves an issued invoice and retry task, not an
editable financial draft. Duplicate issue commands return the original invoice. No second active final invoice for
the same job.
BIL03: An unpaid issued invoice can be voided only when no effective payment, refund or issued credit exists.
Void requires reason, revokes active invoice links, notifies prior recipient and retains the number. A replacement
invoice references the voided one and is numbered anew. Customer/typographical billing details may be
corrected in replacement; approved scope amounts cannot be changed without a separate credited/rebuilt job
workflow. Reissue from the same accepted scope is allowed; scope re-negotiation after issue is outside v1 and
uses a new linked job.
BIL04: Credit notes CN-000001 are immutable, owner-issued reductions of selected invoice line net amounts with
automatically allocated original tax. Require reason and preview. Cumulative credited net cannot exceed residual
invoice line net. Credits cannot increase an invoice or record money returned. An erroneous issued credit cannot
be deleted in v1: explain the limitation before confirmation and direct the owner to create a linked new
invoice/job for any additional charge, with no automatic customer approval claim. This deliberately avoids a
complete accounting journal system.
BIL05: Record payment accepts positive cents, received date no later than today in workspace timezone and no
more than five years earlier, method enum cash, check, bank_transfer, external_card, other, reference up to 100
and note up to 500. Overpayments require an explicit confirmation showing the resulting refund balance. “Mark
paid” opens this form with current amount due; it does not bypass confirmation. All records say Recorded by
business; no bank verification badge.
BIL06: Record refund is enabled only when effective paid money exists and balance is negative. Amount may not
exceed either outstanding refund balance or remaining effective payments. It represents money already returned
externally; show “This records a refund you have already made. It does not send money.” Date and method follow
payment rules. A refund can be partial. Allocate refund cents server-side against effective payments oldest first in
ledger_refund_allocations; cumulative effective allocation cannot exceed a payment. Reversing an erroneous
refund releases its effective allocation without deleting history. Zero entries are prohibited.
BIL07: An erroneous payment or refund can be reversed with mandatory reason, referencing exactly one original
entry. It can be reversed only once; a reversal itself cannot be reversed in v1. To correct amount/date/method,
reverse then create a new entry; retain both visibly. Reversing a payment with dependent refunds is blocked until
erroneous dependent refund records are reversed or the owner resolves the ledger externally. Reversal
transactions must re-evaluate invariant checks under invoice lock. An actual refund must never be reversed
merely to cosmetically permit invoice voiding.
BIL08: Derived invoice states are issued_unpaid, partially_paid, settled, overdue or refund_due, with separate
voided flag. Overdue applies when balance is positive and due date precedes the workspace current date; no late
fees accrue. Credit-to-zero is Settled by credit, not Paid. A receipt for a manual payment is optional owner sharing
with explicit recorded wording; automatic bank/payment confirmations do not exist.
15 Subscription and entitlement contract
SUB01: V1 has entitlement code pro. Products are provisional identifiers jobtoinvoice.pro.monthly and
jobtoinvoice.pro.annual in one Apple subscription group, nominal US prices USD 19.99 and 149.99. Final bundle
prefix and store product identifiers must be recorded before release. Always display StoreKit-localized price and
billing period, not hardcoded price text. The annual option states total annual charge plus monthly equivalent as
secondary information. Monthly is selected by default. No weekly plan or lifetime offer.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 17 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 17 of 42
SUB02: The free tier permits three distinct published jobs over the account lifetime. Unlimited local drafting
within abuse limits is permitted, but publication of a fourth new job requires trial eligibility or active Pro. A job slot
is consumed atomically on first quote publication or direct invoice issue and never again. A slot reservation rolls
back if publication fails before commit. A document delivery failure after commit does not restore the slot.
Trial/paid jobs are marked with publication entitlement so they do not consume unused lifetime free slots.
SUB03: The optional 14-day trial is app-managed, not an Apple introductory subscription offer. It starts only when
the verified owner explicitly taps Start 14 day trial; no card, no automatic charge, no StoreKit purchase sheet.
Store start/end in UTC server time once per owner/workspace, never reset by reinstall or account email change.
Trial permits at most 20 new published jobs, disclosed as “Try all features on up to 20 jobs for 14 days.” Trial
expiry and job cap both apply. At expiry, owner can use any unconsumed free slots or purchase Pro; trial jobs
keep completion rights.
SUB04: Active paid Pro permits new jobs with a disclosed operational fair-use publication cap of 1000 per rolling
30 days and 10 GB retained attachment storage. This is not marketed as unlimited. Internal alerts at 80 percent
usage and a support path precede the cap. Quota restrictions apply only to new job publication/uploads, not
record access, invoice completion, credits or payment/refund tracking. Trial storage cap 500 MB; free tier 250 MB.
Existing uploaded attachments remain readable after downgrade; prevent additional uploads beyond cap but
allow text-only completion.
SUB05: Every published job grants completion rights independent of subscription: edit permitted drafts belonging
to that existing job, send new pre-invoice change requests, issue its invoice, record payments/refunds, issue
credits, resend documents and export. New jobs and duplication into new jobs are subject to current entitlement.
A job is a single site/scope and cannot be reset to a new unrelated customer after publication. This limits abuse
without holding unfinished work hostage.
Billing condition Entitlement and UI behaviour
Purchase pending or
customer cancels sheet No new Pro access; existing free/trial rights remain; never show purchase success
Verified active Pro until verified entitlement expiry; show renewal period and manage link
Auto renewal canceled Pro remains until paid-through expiry; label “Ends on date”
Store billing grace
period Honor verified provider entitlement while active; show billing issue and manage link
Billing retry with no
active entitlement New Pro publication blocked; completion/read rights remain
Refunded or revoked Reconcile provider state, remove prospective Pro rights; do not delete customer records
Provider unavailable Keep last server-verified access up to its known expiry; do not manufacture extensions
Expired Fall back to unused free slots and completion rights; offer monthly/annual plans
Trial ended No charge; clearly state end and remaining free slots
SUB06: Require login before purchase and initialize RevenueCat with stable owner UUID; do not purchase under
anonymous identity. Keep receipt association with its existing app user on restore; automatic transfers to another
owner/workspace are disabled. Restore purchases triggers server reconciliation and either restores the same-
owner entitlement or displays “This purchase is linked to another account. Sign in to that account or contact
support.” Do not expose the other account email. Test the configured RevenueCat transfer behaviour with two
app accounts and one Apple account before release.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 18 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 18 of 42
SUB07: Client purchase success is provisional until backend reconciliation; call the provider server API with secret
credentials. During synchronization show “Purchase received. Checking access…” and preserve transaction
context. Webhooks are triggers, not blindly trusted entitlement assignments. Authenticate webhook, deduplicate
provider event ID, durably enqueue, query authoritative subscriber state and update snapshot. Out-of-order
events cannot override a newer verified state. Poll/reconcile on app foreground when stale over 15 minutes and
nightly for active paid accounts, with rate limits and batching.
SUB08: Do not implement custom proration or grant a second entitlement when switching monthly/annual.
Initiate supported StoreKit plan change in the same subscription group and use the resulting provider effective
dates. Explain price and effective timing using verified store state. Manage subscription opens the supported
Apple management surface. Restore, terms, privacy and support are always visible on the paywall. The app-
managed trial and paid purchase must never be described as the same offer. Sources SREF01, SREF03 and SREF04
inform implementation; verify SDK-specific behaviour in sandbox.
16 Draft persistence and synchronization
SYNC01: Mobile maintains a per-owner SQLite database with encrypted storage using the selected supported
SQLite encryption build and OS-secured key, plus protected attachment files. Expo development builds are
required; Expo Go is not a release environment. On first implementation spike, confirm SQLCipher support in the
selected SDK/build and OS backup exclusion. If unavailable, choose a supported encrypted local persistence
module before storing production records; plaintext fallback is forbidden. Uninstall or device loss can lose never-
synced drafts, so the UI must distinguish local from cloud persistence.
SYNC02: Persist draft changes locally after a 500 ms debounce, and flush on blur/background as OS execution
permits. Show Saving locally until transaction completes, then Saved on this device. While online, queue server
draft writes within two seconds, then show Synced with timestamp only on acknowledgement. Show unsynced
count in Jobs and Settings. OS background termination is not guaranteed to flush unfinished keystrokes; never
advertise zero possible draft loss.
SYNC03: Each mutable resource has server version integer and updated_at. Every PATCH requires If-Match with
that version. A local operation has UUID operation_id, target_id, base_version, mutation payload and dependency
IDs. Server applies once and increments version. On 409 VERSION_CONFLICT, pause that resource queue and
preserve both copies. Never use last-write-wins for amounts, recipients, terms or site identity. User can keep
server copy or save local data as a new draft revision; publication always reviews current server version.
SYNC04: New local IDs are UUIDs accepted by server after owner/tenant validation. Sync dependencies in order:
customer, job, document draft, line items and completed attachments. An attachment still uploading blocks
publication if selected for the customer document; allow explicit Remove pending attachment to proceed. Local
temporary drafts do not consume public document numbers or job slots.
SYNC05: Queued draft retries use exponential delay with jitter from 2 seconds to five minutes. Reconnect triggers
a bounded queue drain; cap 20 concurrent draft operations per device and one per resource. Authoritative
commands such as publish, approve, invoice issue, credits, payments/refunds, deletion and purchase
reconciliation are never auto-issued from an offline draft queue. They require a live user action when connected.
If a live command times out, query its operation result before offering another command.
SYNC06: Cache recent 90 days and up to 500 jobs, plus owner-pinned open jobs, subject to 250 MB document
cache excluding pending attachments. Evict only server-confirmed cache using least-recently-used; never evict
unsynced work automatically. Remote search requires connectivity; local search states “Searching downloaded
jobs.” When switched to another account, lock and wipe previous cache after the unsynced-work confirmation.
No sharing local database between accounts.

17 Documents photos and exports
DOC01: Use one versioned server-rendered HTML-to-PDF template for quotes, change orders, invoices, credit
notes and approval receipts. US Letter, portrait, embedded licensed fonts, readable 10 to 11 pt minimum body,
repeat item-table header, page X of Y, no clipped rows. Show business name/contact, document number/revision,
issued date, customer/site, currency, lines, discounts, rate/tax, total, public notes and terms. No internal notes,
authentication secrets, private customer data unrelated to this document or unverified approval badge.
DOC02: Quote/change PDFs show proposed or accepted/declined/withdrawn/superseded status on generated
status copies, with snapshot content unchanged. Original reviewed bytes and digest remain preserved; an
approval receipt references that original digest. A later status-stamped copy is a distinct artifact with its own hash,
never overwrites original bytes. Invoice PDFs retain issue snapshot and provide a separate current balance/credit
statement when requested; avoid silently regenerating the historical invoice as if it always had the later balance.
DOC03: Media allowed: JPEG, PNG and HEIC from camera or system photo picker, maximum 10 images per
document and 10 MB per source image. No video, arbitrary files, GIF or SVG. Client resizes long edge to 2000 px
and re-encodes; server verifies file signature, decodes, strips EXIF including location, re-encodes approved
JPEG/PNG, and stores accepted output plus metadata. Reject malformed, oversized or decompression-bomb
inputs. HEIC conversion must be proven on real supported devices. Original upload is purged within 24 hours after
processing; no location retention.
DOC04: Photo permission is requested only when selecting Take photo. Photo picker avoids broad photo-library
access. Permission denial offers Choose photo or Continue without photo. A photo attached to a published
revision cannot be silently removed from the historical record. Owner chooses whether a draft photo is public or
internal before publication; internal images never appear in recipient responses or PDFs.
DOC05: Object keys include random IDs and tenant namespace, never public customer names. Private buckets
only. Signed download URLs expire after five minutes and are generated after authorization; browser responses
do not cache private documents publicly. Signed upload authorizes one random object key and size/type
constraints, expires after five minutes, and has no read permission. Completing upload is not equivalent to
successful validation.
EXP01: Owners can export all workspace data from Settings after recent authentication, whether paid or expired.
Asynchronous ZIP includes README, schema version, customers.csv, jobs.csv, document register, ledger.csv,
immutable PDF documents, approval receipts and JSON snapshots; include accepted images with path mapping
and exclude internal staff notes and secrets. UTF-8 CSV with formula-injection protection for cells beginning =, +, -,
@ or control characters; numeric amounts have explicit cents columns and USD labels. Dates use ISO formats with
documented timezone.
EXP02: Export snapshot has a consistent database cutoff; record cutoff timestamp. Target completion within 30
minutes for 1000 jobs/1 GB. Larger exports show progress and are split into numbered ZIPs with manifest and
checksums. Download link requires owner authentication and lasts 24 hours; generated bundle deleted after
seven days. No export email attachments containing full customer data. Repeated export request within 24 hours
reuses same completed bundle or clearly requests a newer one; cap two new bulk exports/day/workspace.
18 Communications and exact transactional copy
NTF01: V1 delivery is transactional email, in-app activity and user-initiated OS share sheet. No automated SMS,
WhatsApp sending, marketing campaigns or background calendar reminders. OS share-sheet completion does not
prove the message was delivered. Owner may manually share the scoped link; approval still requires bound-email
verification. Native push notifications are deferred. V1 owner notification preferences allow optional product/trial


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 20 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 20 of 42
reminders to be disabled; security, requested document delivery and commercial decision notices remain
transactional. The app explains these categories and sends no marketing email without a separate opt-in.
NTF02: Email uses verified product sending domain, SPF, DKIM and DMARC. From display name is “[Business] via
[Product]” with product-controlled envelope and authenticated sender; Reply-To is the verified business contact.
Business-supplied email never becomes an unverified From header. Customer invoices without an approval flow
use the same protected read-only recipient-access mechanism if sent by app email. A manual PDF share is
explicitly owner-controlled disclosure.

NTF03: Outbox delivery states queued, submitting, accepted_by_provider, delivered, bounced, complained and
failed. Accepted is not Delivered. Webhooks update state after signature verification/deduplication. Retry
transient failures at 1, 5, 30 minutes and 2, 8 hours; five attempts then dead-letter plus owner notice. Permanent
bounce suppresses address until owner corrects it through the revision/recipient process. A spam complaint
suppresses automated sending to that address but leaves owner-controlled export available.
NTF04: One request may be manually resent no more than three times per day, at least ten minutes apart, with
no automatic expiry extension. Record attempt ID and provider idempotency key. If provider submission times
out after potential acceptance, reconcile before retry; do not blindly resend. In-app job activity is the
authoritative delivery/status history, not the email inbox.
NTF05: Critical interface copy: offline publish “Reconnect to send this document. Your draft is saved on this
device.” Conflict “This draft changed on another device. Review both versions before continuing.” Expired
approval “This request has expired. Ask the business for a new version.” Stale approval “A newer version is
available. This version cannot be approved.” Ledger warning “This records money handled outside the app. It does

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 21 of 42
not move money.” Subscription expiry “Your plan has ended. You can still finish existing jobs and access your
records.” Never display zero data as an error fallback.
19 Reference architecture and repository
ARC01: Use a TypeScript monorepo with apps/mobile for React Native and Expo development builds, apps/portal
for Next.js customer pages, apps/admin for staff interface, apps/api for Fastify REST API, apps/worker for
background processing and packages/domain for money/schema/state contracts. Use a managed Supabase
project for Auth, PostgreSQL and private Storage. Host API, web and worker in the same US region on a managed
container platform, default Render paid services. Resend is the default transactional mail provider; RevenueCat
manages Apple subscription integration. Use sanitized Sentry error capture and first-party analytics tables. Vendor
substitution requires an architecture decision preserving behaviour and acceptance tests.
ARC02: Mobile and public browsers call domain API only; they do not write commercial records directly through
Supabase REST. Supabase public Auth endpoints are allowed for owner authentication. Commercial tables reside
in a private schema with client grants revoked. API database role is not owner, superuser or BYPASSRLS and uses
per-transaction workspace context set only from verified auth; enforce tenant RLS with FORCE ROW LEVEL
SECURITY and composite tenant foreign keys. System workers use narrowly scoped functions/roles for queued
tasks. Supabase service credentials remain server-only and are never used as routine unrestricted domain
authorization.
ARC03: API verifies JWT and workspace membership, opens transaction, sets tenant context, executes authorized
command and clears context by transaction-local setting. Connection pooling must not leak tenant context
between requests. Customer portal uses a separate scoped API path that invokes narrowly authorized command
handlers after token/code checks. Staff endpoints are separately authenticated. Global lookups such as request-
token hash resolve only to the minimum request/workspace metadata through restricted database functions; no
general cross-tenant list access.
ARC04: A PostgreSQL transactional outbox stores pending PDF, email, export, notification and reconciliation tasks
in the same commit as the business event. Workers claim tasks with bounded row locks and SKIP LOCKED, lease
for 60 seconds, heartbeat for long jobs, retry with idempotent effect IDs. Do not rely on in-memory queues. Never
hold a database transaction open while calling email, storage or billing providers. Generated artifact insert and
completion status must be safe if worker crashes between upload and database commit; reconcile orphan blobs
by job ID.
ARC05: Use currently supported stable dependency releases at project initialization and pin exact versions/lockfile.
Record React Native, Expo, Node runtime, PostgreSQL, PDF renderer, RevenueCat SDK and browser versions in a
checked-in compatibility matrix. This PRD intentionally specifies product contracts rather than inventing future
SDK patch numbers. CI builds must be reproducible and fail on incompatible lockfile changes. Infrastructure
configuration and database migrations live in the owner-controlled repository.
20 Database schema contract
DB01: Use UUID primary keys, timestamptz UTC timestamps, date for commercial local dates, integer/bigint cents
constrained to product limits, numeric(12,3) quantities, and jsonb only for immutable typed snapshots or
versioned event payloads. All tenant tables include workspace_id UUID NOT NULL, id UUID, created_at,
updated_at where mutable, and UNIQUE(workspace_id,id). Every relationship between tenant tables is a
composite foreign key (workspace_id, referenced_id). Auth user IDs reference provider identities through a
controlled application identity mapping. No cascade deletion of published financial records in ordinary CRUD.

DB02: Unless stated otherwise all listed fields are required; “?” denotes nullable, [] means array, and defaults
must be explicit in migrations. created_by is an application actor UUID, with worker actions using a named service
actor. Mutable rows use version integer default 1. JSON payloads validate against checked-in schemas on write
and read. Enums use constrained text plus migration-defined permitted values so new versions do not silently
accept unknown states.

DB03: Index every list path by (workspace_id, updated_at DESC, id DESC); jobs additionally by
(workspace_id,lifecycle,updated_at). Index normalized customer email by workspace, document
(workspace_id,kind,number,revision_no), approval request hash, state/expiry, ledger invoice and time, task
status/available_at and lease_until. Add a partial unique index on approval_requests(workspace_id,job_id)
WHERE state='pending' AND purpose='approval'. A state transition must expire/withdraw the old pending row
before creating its successor in one transaction. Add partial uniqueness for the active non-voided final invoice per
job, enforced using a dedicated invoice registry or immutable issued row plus current-pointer transaction; do not
rely only on UI.
DB04: Immutable-record triggers reject UPDATE/DELETE to commercial payload columns after publication. Status
transitions are separate restricted commands and append audit events. Worker/admin roles do not have arbitrary
writes to financial tables. Ledger reversal trigger/function checks reference belongs to same invoice/workspace
and was not already reversed. Authorization tests must exercise database access paths, not only HTTP handlers.
DB05: Deletion uses a privileged, audited purge workflow outside ordinary application roles. Operational
immutable does not mean impossible to delete on an authorized privacy request. Delete links, derived artifacts
and owner records consistently; segregate only narrowly necessary legal/security records as section 25 specifies.
Backups and restored copies follow the same deletion ledger.
21 API conventions and payloads
API01: Base /v1, JSON UTF-8, HTTPS only. Owner requests use Bearer access token. Public portal uses its HttpOnly
scoped session cookie and CSRF token on mutations. Every state-changing owner/public command requires
Idempotency-Key UUID and a unique request ID; draft PATCH also requires If-Match numeric version. A different
body with a reused idempotency key returns 409 IDEMPOTENCY_MISMATCH. Preserve successful financial
operation deduplication permanently through operation_id uniqueness, even after cached responses expire at 30
days.
API02: Success response is {data,meta:{request_id,server_time}}. List data includes items and next_cursor; default
25, max 100, stable descending (updated_at,id), opaque cursor bound to filters. Error is
{error:{code,message,field_errors,retryable},meta:{request_id}}. Do not expose stack traces, SQL, provider tokens
or tenant existence. Validation is 422, unauthorized 401, permission/entitlement 403, not found 404, stale/state
conflict 409, rate limit 429 with Retry-After, asynchronous accepted 202. Retryable 5xx may still represent a
committed command; resolve operation before replay.
API03: Fields not listed in a request schema are rejected. The client cannot set calculated totals, tenant ownership,
approval state, invoice paid state, server issue time or entitlement. Common pagination query is
cursor?,limit?,search?,state?. Dates accept YYYY-MM-DD; timestamps ISO8601 with Z. Currency USD literal.
Snapshot responses include server-calculated totals, schema_version, version or revision ID and content digest
where applicable.
Draft payload schema
A quote draft body contains job_id UUID, customer_snapshot {name,email?,phone?,billing_address?},
site_snapshot?, public_notes string, terms string, expiry_date date and lines[]. Each line contains client_line_id
UUID, description string, quantity decimal string, unit enum, custom_unit_label?, unit_price_cents integer,
discount_cents integer, tax_bp integer and asset_ids[]. Internal notes are stored only on job, not this snapshot.
Owner business snapshot is applied by server at publish from a reviewed draft preview; if defaults change
between preview and publish, 409 PREVIEW_CHANGED requires a new review.


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 25 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 25 of 42
Change draft adds reason string, expected_scope_version integer, additions[] using the line schema, reductions[]
{source_line_id,net_credit_cents} and public asset IDs. Direct invoice draft uses normal lines and requires
direct_invoice true, issue acknowledgement true, due_date and payment_instructions. Quote-based invoice
preview accepts no editable line prices; it is generated from scope. Credit draft contains invoice_id, reason,
allocations[] {invoice_line_id,net_credit_cents}. Payment body contains amount_cents, effective_date, method,
reference?,note?,confirm_overpayment boolean default false.
Example request
POST /v1/jobs/{job_id}/changes with Idempotency-Key and expected current version creates a draft. A valid body
is:
{
"expected_scope_version": 1,
"reason": "Customer requested replacement of a second handle",
"additions": [{
"client_line_id": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
"description": "Supply and fit second door handle",
"quantity": "1.000",
"unit": "item",
"unit_price_cents": 8500,
"discount_cents": 0,
"tax_bp": 0,
"asset_ids": []
}],
"reductions": []
}
The server returns a draft ID, version, old total, addition total, reduction total, change total and new total. This
does not publish, email or approve the change. A separate publish command binds preview_hash, recipient email
and expiry date after owner review. Replacing a still-pending quote also requires replace_pending_request_id and
confirmation that its recipient can no longer approve the old version. The UUID is fictional fixture data.

API04: Direct-invoice editing uses the generic draft routes: POST /jobs creates mode direct_invoice and its initial
draft; preview uses /drafts/{id}/preview and issue uses /jobs/{id}/issue-invoice with that draft preview_hash. GET
/jobs/{id} includes its drafts/document summaries; a separate document list endpoint is unnecessary in v1. After
issue, all amount changes follow the credit/replacement rules.
API05: Read-only invoice/credit access shares the request/session machinery with approval requests but purpose
is view_only, with state pending meaning access enabled and no decision allowed. Do not expire this state
through the approval-expiry worker; use access expiry. Its GET portal response has
allowed_actions=[download,report] and no approval controls. POST decision returns 403 for this purpose. Persist
purpose approval/view_only on approval_requests; approval-only pending uniqueness excludes view_only
requests. All portal code routes validate purpose. For view_only requests expires_at controls access, default 90
days; owner may issue a fresh request. This distinction must be in migration/schema and OpenAPI, not inferred
from UI. For approved or declined requests, GET portal/receipt returns the decision; for view_only requests it
returns document access metadata rather than inventing a consent receipt.
23 Transaction algorithms
TX01 Publish: verify owner and draft version; lock job, allowances and current request; verify completion
entitlement or consume available new-job slot; reject any unrelated pending approval; if
replace_pending_request_id explicitly identifies the current quote request with the expected version, supersede
it atomically and invalidate its sessions; recalculate using server domain package; match preview hash; validate
ready assets; allocate number/revision; insert immutable snapshot/lines/assets; create tokenized request and
durable outbox; mark draft published and job active; commit. Return document/request IDs immediately. Any
precommit failure rolls back all side effects. Generate no external email inside transaction.
TX02 Approve: verify recipient session and CSRF; lock request and job; compare now with expiry, state, document
hash and expected scope version; verify source reduction caps; insert unique decision; apply append-only scope
entries; mark quote/change accepted; increment scope_version; commit receipt/notification tasks with the
decision. The online response comes from committed data. Never accept after expiry based on the time the
customer first opened the page.
TX03 Invoice issue: lock job; verify current scope/preview hash and absence of pending/unresolved changes;
validate direct-mode exception if used; enforce one active invoice; insert snapshot/lines and number; set active
invoice pointer/lifecycle; append audit/outbox; commit. A response timeout is recovered through operation_id.
Worker failure cannot permit a duplicate invoice.
TX04 Credit/payment/refund/reversal: lock invoice; load effective ledger and cumulative credits; validate caps
and transaction-specific conditions; insert append-only entry or credit snapshot; recompute balance; append
audit/outbox; commit. Concurrent commands must serialize on the same invoice and must never both spend the
same remaining credit/refund capacity.
TX05 Billing: authenticate and store webhook event by provider/external ID; acknowledge only after durable
persistence. Worker retrieves current provider subscriber state, validates configured environment and user


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 30 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 30 of 42
mapping, compares effective dates, updates entitlement snapshot and audit. If provider unavailable, retry
without revoking previously valid access prematurely. Nightly reconciliation repairs missed events.
TX06 Public link compromise: revoke request access tokens and sessions, block future decisions on compromised
pending request, preserve already committed decisions, issue fresh request requiring verification and review
when appropriate. Never erase historical approval evidence as a security shortcut. Notify owner through verified
channel and attach incident ID.
24 Security and abuse controls
SEC01: Enforce HTTPS/TLS, secure cookies, HSTS on owned web domains, exact-origin CORS and a restrictive
Content Security Policy. Do not place authentication tokens in localStorage, URLs, analytics properties or error
reports. Keep public review pages free of third-party scripts. Escape all user content; render plain text only. No
remote user HTML, arbitrary URL PDF fetches or externally embedded images, preventing PDF-renderer SSRF and
data leakage.
SEC02: Verify every owner object, composite relation, selected source line and asset belongs to the same
workspace/job. A valid ID from another tenant must never be usable as a source_line_id, attachment, invoice or
export. Rate-limit owner API to 120 requests/minute/user with separate publication limit 20/hour/workspace and
daily email limit 100 free/trial, 500 paid, plus provider safeguards. Completion rights do not bypass abuse limits;
legitimate higher volume uses support rather than silent record lockout. Public OTP limits are separately stricter.
SEC03: File validation runs in isolated worker resources, with decode memory/time limits. Product infrastructure
rejects upload bodies larger than the maximum before processing. Server-generated artifact keys are not user-
controlled. Use randomized IDs and opaque tokens rather than sequential document numbers as access
credentials. Publish webhook routes have signature/secret checks, replay deduplication, size limits and fail-closed
processing.
SEC04: Source control contains no service keys, signing certificates, database passwords or actual customer
samples. Secret values live in owner-controlled managed secret stores and are scoped by environment. Rotate on
staff departure or suspected compromise. Public mobile configuration contains only intended public keys, not
Supabase service role, RevenueCat server key, email API secret or PDF/download signing keys.
SEC05: Support console is behind separate staff authentication, MFA and least privilege. Content access requires
owner grant for one case, expires after 24 hours and is revocable. Staff action requires reason and immutable
audit; export and financial editing remain prohibited. Break-glass operational access requires incident record and
two-person authorization in production, with owner notification where appropriate. This is an engineering control
to implement, not a request for the product owner to approve ordinary document creation now.
SEC06: Provide Report a problem on customer pages for fraudulent/abusive requests. Repeated complaints
suspend outbound sending after review; affected owners retain authenticated read/export subject to genuine
security restrictions. No searchable public directory of businesses or documents. Domain/content moderation is
bounded to private transactional usage; user data is not licensed for model training or advertising.
SEC07: Before launch run automated dependency and secret scanning, database isolation tests, API authorization
tests, upload attack fixtures, portal token/CSRF tests and a focused independent security review of
approvals/billing/tenant boundaries. Resolve all exploitable critical/high findings before production. Record
residual low-risk issues with owner and due date; do not describe scanning alone as penetration testing.

25 Privacy retention and account deletion
PRV01: Publish a privacy notice describing owner/contact details, customer records, photos, commercial
documents, approval verification/evidence, service providers, retention, deletion and international access by
support. Customer information is processed to provide the operator's service; actual legal roles and contractual
wording require counsel review for the chosen entity and markets. The technical choices here are policy
requirements, not a declaration of legal compliance.
PRV02: Default retention while an account exists: commercial documents, receipts, ledger and business history
persist until account deletion; do not promise a legally sufficient archival term. Retain operational delivery logs
and error logs 30 days, security logs 90 days, raw approval IP/user-agent evidence 90 days then delete it, and core
decision receipt fields for as long as the associated record. Minimized aggregate product metrics may persist 13
months with per-user deletion capability. Suppress content from telemetry at ingestion. Owner exports are the
customer's archival mechanism; app account existence is not a guaranteed permanent archive.
PRV03: Account deletion is available inside Settings, not only by emailing support. Reauthenticate within five
minutes, display scope and consequences, offer export, and require typing DELETE. Do not force export,
subscription cancellation or a support call before accepting deletion. Apple subscription cancellation is separate;
show Manage subscription and explain that deleting the account does not itself guarantee cancellation. Never
claim the app can cancel an Apple subscription by deleting a database row. Source SREF02 informs this flow.
PRV04: On confirmed deletion, immediately revoke owner and customer access, prevent new writes/sends,
cancel pending approvals and remove the account from analytics collection. Start purge within 24 hours and
complete live app-record/object deletion within 30 days. Customer live links become unavailable; users must be
warned that recipients will lose future portal access. Preserve only specifically documented records needed for
tax, fraud, disputes or other valid retention obligations in a restricted separate store with category, basis, deadline
and authorized role. Legal reviewer supplies those categories before launch; there is no default blanket
exemption retaining every invoice.
PRV05: Managed database backups expire within the configured 35-day maximum. A deletion ledger is applied
before any restored system is exposed to users, so deleted records cannot reappear. Purge Storage objects
separately; do not assume database backup or row deletion deletes photos/PDFs. Request deletion from Auth,
RevenueCat, error/analytics and email systems where applicable; distinguish unavoidable provider financial
retention from app data. Verify provider capabilities and publish accurate retention wording before release.
PRV06: The account remains locked during purge; no self-service cancellation of deletion after confirmed
irreversible action in v1. Provide a deletion receipt before credentials are removed. The narrow fraud-prevention
record for previously used trials is a keyed pseudonymous identifier only where reviewed and necessary, retained
at most 12 months; it is still personal data, not anonymous. Do not secretly retain full profiles to prevent another
free trial. The business accepts some trial abuse rather than violating published deletion commitments.
26 Accessibility performance and resilience
NFR01: Target WCAG 2.2 AA for the customer portal and corresponding native accessibility quality. Support
VoiceOver labels, headings, error announcements, logical focus, text alternatives for meaningful images, system
font scaling, keyboard operation on web, reduced motion and visible focus. Approval and payment actions must
remain usable without colour perception or precise gestures. Photos have owner-entered optional captions; the
scope text must contain necessary work details so photos are not the only accessible description. Source SREF05 is
the normative web accessibility reference.
NFR02: Test on iPhone SE third generation and a current standard iPhone at minimum, with supported older OS
and latest stable iOS, low storage, airplane mode and network interruption. Browser matrix: Safari on supported


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 32 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 32 of 42
iPhone OS, Chrome Android current and previous major, Chrome/Edge desktop current and previous major, Safari
macOS current. No iPad-specific operator layout is promised, but store compatibility mode must not break core
use if distributed there.
NFR03: Under a reference load of 100 concurrent active owners, 20 recipient sessions and 10 workers, target API
read p95 below 500 ms and transactional write p95 below 800 ms excluding external-provider latency, measured
server-side. Customer portal meaningful content after verification below 2.5 seconds on a representative 4G
connection. PDF ready p95 under 15 seconds for 20 lines/two images, under 60 seconds for the supported
maximum. These are acceptance targets to test, not measured present performance.
NFR04: Target 99.9 percent monthly API/portal availability excluding preannounced maintenance, with measured
synthetic health checks. Use managed database point-in-time recovery with recovery point objective at most 15
minutes and recovery time objective at most four hours for regional data corruption recovery. Configure a
provider plan that can support those objectives. Encrypted object versions/backups require separate restoration
verification. A successful database backup alone does not meet recovery acceptance.
NFR05: Owner draft changes must survive app termination after the local Saved indicator. Committed server
records must survive API/worker restarts. PDF/email failures are visible and retryable. If database unavailable, do
not return invented empty lists or falsely successful publications. If storage unavailable, block publication
involving unfinished attachments while preserving draft text. If billing unavailable, preserve last verified
entitlements to known expiry and show access-check status.
NFR06: Timeout defaults: mobile reads 15 seconds, commands 20 seconds, public decision 20 seconds, provider
calls 10 seconds with bounded retries outside business transactions. Background tasks use workload-specific
limits: PDF 60 seconds, individual image 30 seconds, export batch five minutes with resumable checkpoints. Never
auto-retry a non-idempotent external effect without resolving its effect key.
27 Analytics instrumentation
ANA01: Implement a first-party event schema with event_id UUID, event_name, schema_version, occurred_at,
received_at, pseudonymous owner ID, optional opaque job ID, app version, platform and allowlisted properties.
Never send customer names/emails, addresses, note text, invoice descriptions, approval names, URLs/tokens,
photos or payment references. Pseudonymous owner IDs are random mapped identifiers, not raw email hashes.
Exports/deletion must account for the mapping.

ANA02: Server business events are authoritative and deduplicated; clients do not emit a second purchase_verified
or document_published. Offline UI events batch at most 50 and expire after seven days. Conversion reports
exclude demo/test/staff accounts and sandbox transactions. Define cohort start as signup for activation and first
verified paid transaction for subscription retention. Store invoices paid by operators' customers are unrelated to
app subscription revenue.
ANA03: V1 acquisition reporting uses campaign-level spend imports and self-reported source with unknown
bucket. No deterministic install-to-ad promise. Apple's privacy-preserving attribution integration may be added
only after a separate validated specification; do not install ad SDKs merely to satisfy an assumed metric.
Experimentation is limited initially to pre-paywall copy and creative entry points, never calculation, customer
consent or entitlement correctness. No simultaneous untracked pricing tests.
28 Acceptance test matrix
Each test is a developer/QA requirement, not a claim that the unbuilt app has passed. Link automated tests and
manual evidence to IDs in the release tracker. Unit tests cover domain functions; integration tests use real
database constraints; end-to-end tests use sandbox providers and controlled test mailboxes; physical device tests
cover OS lifecycle and billing.

workspace
Exactly one workspace, defaults and allowances; restart resumes correct

29 Developer delivery and definition of done
DEL01: Deliver an owner-controlled repository with complete source, dependency lockfiles, environment
templates containing names only, reproducible local setup, mobile build configuration, API/worker Dockerfiles,
migrations, seed fixtures and infrastructure configuration. No proprietary contractor account may be the sole
owner of the code, store listing, domain, billing project or production database. Document licences for fonts,
icons and dependencies.
DEL02: Deliver executable OpenAPI 3.1 schemas for every endpoint, request/response examples and documented
error codes matching this PRD; generate or validate mobile API client types against them. Deliver an entity
relationship diagram, migration order, schema constraints and query/index performance notes. The table in
section 20 is a design contract; production SQL must enforce it with tests, not just document it.
DEL03: Deliver editable interface source, all S01 to S28 states, responsive portal frames, design tokens, icons,
launch assets and a clickable main-flow prototype. Implement supplied copy with localization keys, not scattered
literals. QA must verify the implemented screens against that approved design output. No competitor assets,
copied brand identity or scraped protected illustrations.
DEL04: Each feature ticket is done only when domain tests, authorization checks, loading/empty/offline/error
states, accessibility labels, analytics event if required, structured operational logs, migration rollback/forward
compatibility and documentation are included. Business owner acceptance is needed for product outcome, not
for every code line. Do not close tickets with “backend later” when the flow appears interactive but is a mock.
DEL05: Final handover includes staging URL, TestFlight build, test account procedure, customer approval test
mailbox workflow, QA matrix evidence, release notes, app-store submission package, runbooks, backup drill
evidence, security findings disposition, known limitations and a recorded demonstration of the complete real
sandbox journey. Supply a deployment and credential-rotation walkthrough. Secrets are transferred securely,
never pasted into documentation or chat.

6 Production release Business inputs complete, store package, phased rollout,

Release checklist signed, rollback tested,
support staffed
Indicative effort: 10 to 14 calendar weeks for two experienced engineers with part-time design, QA and product
oversight, after quick technical spikes. This is a planning range, not a fixed bid or guarantee. It is longer than a
bare invoice-generator MVP because offline recovery, secure approval, corrections and production operations are
real work. Estimate each stage in the team's own backlog before committing a delivery date. Scope cuts must
preserve immutable money and approvals; defer secondary UI polish or a platform instead.
31 Operations monitoring and incident response
OPS01: Maintain development, staging and production as separate Auth, database, storage, email and
RevenueCat environments. Sandbox purchases never grant production entitlement. Staging sends only to
allowlisted test domains/mailboxes and visually watermarks every generated document TEST. Never copy
production personal data into development; seed fictional fixtures. Production migrations require a backup
checkpoint and tested forward-compatible rollout.
OPS02: CI gates include lint/types, domain/financial tests, API contract validation, migrations on clean database,
tenant isolation tests, dependency/secret scans, worker idempotency tests and a signed mobile build smoke test.
Staging end-to-end tests run on every release candidate. Use feature flags to disable new publication or billing
initiation during incidents without disabling read/export/known-safe completion. Do not use remote code
changes to bypass applicable store review.
OPS03: Log structured request_id, operation_id, tenant pseudonym, endpoint, duration, status/error code and
worker effect ID. Redact authorization headers, cookies, token fragments, emails, commercial text, attachments
and payment references before logs leave the process. Sentry session replay and screenshots are disabled on all
screens. Dashboard charts: API error rate and latency, queue age, publication-to-PDF time, email failures,
duplicate command rate, billing reconciliation age, backup freshness, crash-free sessions and storage growth.
OPS04: Alert on any detected cross-tenant access, snapshot hash mismatch or negative source balance
immediately; on-call treats it as severity 1. Alert if p95 write latency exceeds two seconds for ten minutes, API 5xx
exceeds two percent for five minutes, oldest normal task age exceeds ten minutes, billing reconciliation is stale
over one hour for repeated failures, or backup success is absent beyond scheduled window. Route alerts to an
actually staffed on-call channel; a dashboard alone is not incident response.
OPS05: Severity 1 includes data disclosure, corrupted issued documents or widespread unavailable approvals.
Target acknowledgement within 30 minutes during production coverage, disable the unsafe write path, preserve
evidence and open incident record. Severity 2 includes partial email/PDF/provider outage without lost
commitments; acknowledge within four business hours. Publish status updates only with verified facts. Data
breach communications follow reviewed obligations and entity-specific process; do not invent universal
notification deadlines.
OPS06: Restore runbook: isolate affected environment; establish corruption cutoff; restore database to new
instance; restore matching object versions; replay deletion ledger and verified immutable operation records;


<!-- SOURCE PAGE 38 -->

JOB TO INVOICE | DEVELOPER SPECIFICATION | VERSION 1.0
Page 38 of 42
compare snapshot/PDF hashes and counts; reconcile subscription state and unresolved outbox effects; run
isolation/ledger smoke tests; switch traffic only after checks. Do not replay email tasks blindly from old backups.
Test this runbook before launch and quarterly afterward.
OPS07: Deploy API backward-compatible with previous mobile version, then worker/portal, then mobile. Add
nullable/defaulted fields before requiring them; retire fields only after minimum-version policy and adoption
review. API supports current and prior app release for at least 90 days. Critical security minimum-version block
may require update but should provide secure export/support access. Rollback cannot undo committed financial
history; repair with forward migrations and approved correction commands.
OPS08: Scheduled jobs: poll outbox continuously; expire pending requests every minute while endpoints enforce
exact expiry; cleanup stale uploads hourly; reconcile paid entitlements nightly; retry bounded reconciliation
backlog every five minutes; generate trial reminders once two days before expiry; purge exports daily; apply
retention/deletion daily; verify backup status daily; calculate deidentified cohort reports daily. Every schedule has
a unique execution key and observability.
32 Store submission and release acceptance
REL01: Apple release must use the then-current required SDK/toolchain, accurate app privacy labels and SDK
privacy manifests/required-reason declarations where applicable. Check current Apple guidelines before
submission, especially digital-feature billing, subscription presentation, privacy and account deletion. This
specification chooses Apple in-app subscriptions and does not depend on region-specific external-purchase
exceptions. Physical job payments are not processed by the app. Source SREF01 supplies the policy baseline;
passing tests cannot guarantee store approval.
REL02: Prepare owned developer account, bundle ID, signing, distribution certificates, subscription
group/products, privacy policy URL, terms URL, support URL/contact, store description, screenshots from the
actual production-equivalent build, age-rating answers and review notes. Review must have a fully functional
controlled demo mode or dedicated review identity and documented access to test inboxes without a global
authentication bypass. Explain that the 14-day app trial never automatically charges and that customer approval is
a separate web flow.
REL03: Initial rollout is invitation-only TestFlight with 15 to 25 real pilot operators, followed by limited public
release and staged increase. Test data clearly separated from real customer records. Pilot terms and live email
expectations must be clear. No paid acquisition at scale until real publication, approval, invoice, cancellation and
recovery flows have passed. Rollout changes are operational releases, not automatic permission to spend
advertising budget.

Initial recurring infrastructure budget is a planning allowance of USD 250 to 750 per month for properly
provisioned managed services and staging, excluding staff, media and store/revenue-based fees. It is not a vendor
quotation. Engineering must obtain current service estimates at provisioning, choose paid plans meeting
backup/availability requirements, and report actual cost per active owner monthly. Per-user contribution
assumptions from the venture analysis are targets, not permission to omit required reliability services.
34 Business inputs and decision register
These are the only unavoidable owner-supplied launch inputs. Developers can build with explicit non-production
defaults now; they must not manufacture legal identities, account access or approvals. Scope choices already
made in this PRD do not require repeated clarification.

requirements or progress billing require a scoped revision and cost estimate. Do not expand them informally
through customer-support requests. Maintain a decision log with ID, date, decision, evidence, owner, impacted
requirement/test IDs and migration implications.

The preceding venture recommendation selected the invoicing category using reported competitor evidence. Its
revenue estimates, acquisition figures, conversion assumptions and retention scenarios are not implemented
product facts and must not appear as customer-facing claims. No guarantee of payment, recovered revenue,
signature enforceability, tax correctness or zero possible data loss is authorized by this PRD.
36 Handover summary and traceability
The release succeeds when a real owner can record and publish a quote, a real customer can approve the exact
version, the owner can capture and obtain approval for a change, and the final invoice and ledger remain correct
through interruptions, corrections, subscription changes and account lifecycle events. Every included feature
serves that complete journey.

A developer handover is incomplete if it provides only a working-looking interface. It must include the data
integrity, operational recovery, customer verification, subscription handling and test evidence specified here.
Product, engineering, QA and operations leads record acceptance against the same version of this document
before the public launch.
